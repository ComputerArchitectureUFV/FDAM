# FDAM: Framework for Dataflow Accelerators Management  

  This repository we propose a novel framework to automatically integrate hardware accelerator cores in a final architecture by generating a HW/SW interface for an Intel CPU-FPGA modern platform.

  Our goal is to simplify the Intel Open Programmable Acceleration Engine (OPAE) by introducing a novel abstraction layer with a simple stream protocol channel. We've built a energy efficient and fast implementation, capable of peforming 131.7 Gops/s and a power efficiency of up to 353.7 Gops/W even when we bound the memory bandwidth to 12 GB/s
